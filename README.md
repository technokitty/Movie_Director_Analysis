# Movie_Director_Analysis

This repository shows off my data analysis piece that was a part of a larger project analyzing movie data. I was interested in movie directors; who are the most prolific directors and what kinds of funding do these top directors get to work with. The jupyter notebook file takes in a Kaggle dataset called The Movies Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset). It uses the two files movies_metadata.csv and credits.csv to complete the analysis. To run the notebook sucessfully on your own you can download those files and change the second cell in the .ipynb file depending on where you store the files.
